# ThreeBodyProblem

Work-in-Progress

Soon to be a full fledged application that allows you to mess around with N-bodies in space. 
This project is also here to help me with my understanding of Orbital Mechanics and how to apply them.

Current Iteration:
- Support for two bodies in space; their inital poisition and velocties, in two dimensions.
- Plotting capabilities to see object trajectories
